			<h2>Will Salt/Sugar dissolve faster in water?</h2>
			<p class="exp"> I thought that sugar would dissolve faster then salt in water</p>
			<h3>Procedure</h3>
			<p class="exp"> I measured out 1tbs of salt and 1tbs of sugar. I placed both into small cups. Then I measured out 1/3 a cup of water and placed it both jars. I then took the cups of both the salt and the sugar and poured them into the water at the same time.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p class="exp">I waited and waited and waited. But it never dissolved. I came back about a day later and the salt was compleatly gone! There was still a surprisingly large amount of sugar left in the bottom of a jar. In conclusion, salt dissolves faster in water.</p>
